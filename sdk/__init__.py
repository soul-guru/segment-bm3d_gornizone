# Hello!
# 
# Here are a couple of things you should consider when architecting SDK modules.
# These requirements will help you keep your code clean and as readable, maintainable,
# and context-independent as possible. They will also fit perfectly into the ideology
# of research-with-quick-implementation
#
# - 1 function - 1 module
# - don't use dynamic imports in modules.
# - module = specific operation
